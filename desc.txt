                              AUTOMATIC DRUG DISPENSER
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Develop a web system that enables the doctor to prescribe medicines on an app. This app 
then converts the prescription to a QR code. The patient then uses the automatic drug 
dispenser to get the drugs based on the QR code.

Need to integrate with an internally developed basic vending machine for this project.

NOTE: you should make an APPLICATION that links with a WEBSITE too.
